The solution focuses on preventing the reassignment of the object within the loop.  One approach involves ensuring that the function modifying the object does not create a new instance of the object but instead modifies the existing instance. Here is the corrected code:

```php
class MyClass {
    public $property = 'initial value';
}

function modifyObject(MyClass &$obj) {
    //Avoid reassignment, modify the properties instead
    $obj->property = 'modified';
}

$obj = new MyClass();

for ($i = 0; $i < 5; $i++) {
    $obj->property = 'value ' . $i;
    echo "Iteration {$i}: ". $obj->property . "\n";
    modifyObject($obj); //Object is now properly modified
}
```

By directly modifying the object's properties instead of re-assigning the object itself, the loop will correctly operate on the intended object throughout its iterations.
