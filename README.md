# Unexpected Object Property Behavior in PHP Loops

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in PHP related to object property modification within loops. When an object's reference is changed within a loop, subsequent iterations may operate on a different object than intended, leading to unexpected results.

The `bug.php` file shows the problematic code, and `bugSolution.php` provides a corrected version.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `bug.php` using a PHP interpreter.
3. Observe the unexpected output.
4. Compare with the expected output and the corrected code in `bugSolution.php`.

## Bug Description

The core issue lies in modifying or re-assigning the object reference within the loop, causing the loop to work with a different object on each iteration after the reassignment. This leads to unpredictable behavior and can make debugging difficult.

## Solution

The solution involves careful consideration of object references and avoiding modifications that change the object's identity within the loop.
