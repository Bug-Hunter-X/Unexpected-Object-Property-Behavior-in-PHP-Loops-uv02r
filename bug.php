In PHP, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with object properties, especially within loops or conditional statements. Consider this scenario:

```php
class MyClass {
    public $property = 'initial value';
}

$obj = new MyClass();

for ($i = 0; $i < 5; $i++) {
    $obj->property = 'value ' . $i;
    echo "Iteration {$i}: ". $obj->property . "\n";
}

//Expected output:
//Iteration 0: value 0
//Iteration 1: value 1
//Iteration 2: value 2
//Iteration 3: value 3
//Iteration 4: value 4
```

This code seems straightforward; it modifies the `property` of `$obj` in each loop iteration. However, a surprising outcome may occur if `$obj` is unexpectedly modified or reassigned within the loop's scope.  For instance, imagine a situation where a function modifies `$obj` or replaces it with a different instance of `MyClass`.

```php
class MyClass {
    public $property = 'initial value';
}

function modifyObject(MyClass &$obj) {
    $obj = new MyClass(); // Reassigns the object
}

$obj = new MyClass();

for ($i = 0; $i < 5; $i++) {
    $obj->property = 'value ' . $i;
    echo "Iteration {$i}: ". $obj->property . "\n";
    modifyObject($obj); //The object is modified here!
}
```

In this modified code, the `modifyObject` function reassigns `$obj`. As a result, the subsequent iterations of the loop operate on a different object than the one initially assigned, leading to unexpected output and potentially hard-to-debug behavior.
